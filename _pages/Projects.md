# Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security
  My take on this will use as little technical terms as possible. 
  
  Project: Program Synthesis to create Security Scripts
  
  
  Description: 
    My take on program synthesis is that it is the new frontier in AI that hasn't been explored much. 
    I think I have some way of being able to get really close to program synthesis. 
    
  Method: 
    I will be using fast.ai for the neural networks because they have been trained already and allow us to easily train 
    the networks. I will be using the Project CodeNet database for the python code examples. I will then simply feed the examples as images
    to the neural network and have it recognize the programs and label them. 
    
    Afterwards, 
    I will do the same thing but for programs that have desired outputs, like programs that calculate some kind of function. I'll create my 
    own database of these programs, which I will get from open source sources, and then get the neural network to learn images of those programs and 
    label them with their output result. 
    
    
    
    I will then use a neural network to determine which programs are not likely to have the desired user output in order to limit the search space of the programs. 
    
    Lastly, I will use functions and have a neural network learn how to insert parameters into them using my own domain-specific-language. When coding new programs, I will use the
    domain-specific language , feed it through the neural network as an image and have it do enumeration search to find the correct paraemeters for the user's desired output.
